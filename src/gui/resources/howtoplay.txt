Create the longest line you can, rotating your tiles 
to avoid walls, the center tile & other players' lines. 
The game ends when all players are unable to place 
more tiles, and the player with the highest score wins.

Use the arrow keys or the scroll-wheel to rotate 
your tile, then hit Enter to place it. You can choose 
between your current tile or the spare one shown 
on the right by clicking Swap.
